change how we handle struct members. we probably want a var_decl node which contains type and name.

prevent duplicate arguments

do we want to turn a *= b into a = a * (b) ???
	seems like less type checking and code gen

make a separate pass to turn every compile-time-known expression into the actual value rather than the full expression???
